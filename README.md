# Neural Networks for discrimination between 1 and 2 particle events
Summer Fellow 2023 at Neutrinos Group at IFAE about the rejection of events with multiple interactions in the near detector ND280 of the T2K experiment.

In the file *"Documentation Neural Networks for discrimination between 1 and 2 particle events.pdf"*, you will find a brief introduction to the project, as well as an explanation of each generated code.The folders in the repository are organized based on the grouping of the codes, as described in this documentation.

You'll also find the project's primary outcomes and results in the file titled *"Presentation 1 and 2 particles event discrimination using a CNN.pdf"*.
